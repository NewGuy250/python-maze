# Maze using BFS

This code implements a maze-solving program in Python using the curses library to display the maze and highlight the path to the exit. 
It uses the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point ("O") to the exit ("X"). 
Walls are represented by "#" and open paths by " ".
